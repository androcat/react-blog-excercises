Complete these five apps. You should be able to build these each from scratch, beginning with a new Vite deployment each time. 

- a) Blog Form: Create a form that saves a blog post to state. The post
  should have a title and a body. It does not need to display blog posts, just
  save them.

- b) Contact Form: Create a form to store a person's information. It should save their first name, last name,
  address, and phone number.  It should save the person's info to state.

- c) Blog Reading App: Create a "blog reading app" with a list of blog posts on the
  left side. When you click on a post title, it opens that post on the right sie of the screen.
  Hint: which blog post is selected is "application state".

- d) Bookmarking App: Create a bookmarking app where you can save URLs. It should have a form
  where you enter the URL, a title, and a "tag". There should be a list of all
  the URLs, as well as a list of all the tags (this should be generated
  dynamically from the link array). When you click on a tag, the link list
  should show only links with that tags. Hints: which tag is selected is "application
  state", and you can filter a collection with `Array.prototype.filter(...)`.

- e) CMS App: Create a complete blog CMS from scratch, allowing you to create, read,
  update, and delete blog posts.
